As you probably know by now, Elon Musk has just announced a new AI venture called xAI.\n\nIn December 2015, when nobody was talking about AI, Mr. Tiwari wrote:\nI’ve never found a company that possessed the ability to go up as much as NVIDIA will. It’s poised to become the next tech giant because of its pioneering work in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nEarlier this year, Nvidia crossed the \$1 trillion market cap, becoming a tech giant just like he predicted…",

And the Nasdaq 100 is even closer to a 10% correction as it\'s down 9.2% from its highest point in a year.\n\nTwo of the leading solar plays in the S&P 500 are suffering the most.\n\nSolarEdge, a maker of inverters for solar power, has seen shares collapse more than 70% from their 52-week high notched on Feb. 15 of this year. Shares just this year are off 64.4%.\n\n  But the sell-off isn\'t driven by any foreseeable business drops. Analysts think the company\'s profit will rise nearly 17% this year to \$6.95 a share on an adjusted basis. And for 2024, analysts are calling for nearly 3% more growth in profit.\n\n',

These factors include the prospect of interest rates remaining elevated, concerns related to high yield bonds, an uptick in oil prices, and the ongoing conflict between Israel and the terrorist organization Hamas, all of which have played a role in dampening market activity.\n\nHowever, for investors seeking signs that the mood is about to change, Bank of America strategists have some good news. The bank has drawn attention to its Bull and Bear Indicator, which recently entered the “extreme bearish” zone, signaling a contrarian buying opportunity for stocks.\n\nFurthermore, the most recent signal coincided with another contrarian buying opportunity, as investors increased their cash allocation levels.',
